While at our ceremony and reception we have a few rules we would like you to follow. Simple things and nothing too hard to remember either. So here we go. Batman says...

**DO**

Have fun at every moment you can. By watching Chris & Emma getting married, playing some of the outdoor games, signing the guest picture, enjoying treats, checking out the photobooth with vintage props, dancing to a few oldies songs, and catching up with family & friends next to the bar.

**DON'T**

Bring bug spray with 'DEET'. The venue is at a Bed & Breakfast and 'U-Pick' farm. The owners are quite insistent about this one issue. Deet is not good for the grass and surrounding plant life, plus the animals she has at the location. We will have a few options for you to use if bugs become an issue.

**DO**

Bring your dancing shoes. We will have a small dancing area where the awesome DJ will be playing many classic songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s for our entertainment.

**DON'T**

Party too hard. The owners won't tolerate extreme stupidity and excessive loud party goers outside of the reception area. We need everyone to be respectful of this because the owners do live in the Bed & Breakfast on site.

**DO**

Dress the part if you want to. Anything 1950s is encouraged, but not mandatory. We would love to see swing dresses, hair pieces, dolled up hairdos, red lipstick, slicked back hair and even a 'greaser' look here and there too. But remember the ceremony is outside on grass, so you need to be able to walk on grass in your styling heels ladies. So a small heel or flat is recommended.

**DON'T**

Drink and Drive. We have arranged for a take home transportation service that will drive you anywhere within Red Deer, Blackfalds and Lacombe. If you do have a few too many drinks please take this transportation home or to your hotel. Then retrieve your vehicle the following morning. Please retrieve your vehicle before noon.
