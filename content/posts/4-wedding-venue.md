Try searching the internet for wedding venues in and around Red Deer... there
aren't too many options. We decided on an outdoor space, so that meant
hotels were out. We discovered a beautiful location called "The Barn" just
outside of Olds. Rental of the barn alone was $7,000!!! That one was definitely
out. Then we zeroed in on a couple of locations. One at the Canyon Ski Hill in
Red Deer and a little known location called Billyco Junction just between
Blackfalds and Lacombe.

To start the ball rolling on all other items to do with the wedding it was a
high priority to find a location for the ceremony and main event. We checked
into both locations. The ski hill was nice, but it came with a few restrictions
we weren't fans of. Then we visited Billyco Junction.

It was once a pig farm that had been converted into a bed & breakfast, plus a
"u-pick" farm. We met with Edie, the proprietor, and discovered she was
relatively new to the wedding venue business. She showed us around the property
so we could see various locations where a ceremony could take place. The place
was gorgeous even early in the year when the leaves and greenery hadn't fully
grown in yet. We also checked out what she had listed as 'the shed' on the
website. It is a place where the rest of the main event will take place, or even
the ceremony itself if the weather doesn't cooperate.

The shed was a huge machine shop that has been converted into a location for
weddings and other events. It was MASSIVE and perfect. A little rustic, open
and a space that could become a delightful space for a wedding. Edie also showed
us the locations in the main building where the men get ready for the big day
and then the honeymoon suite where the girls get ready.

The venue has everything. Open green space, an indoor option, we have the
location for 3 days, it comes with a honeymoon suite, and it is easy to get to.
What more could we want? We had found our venue and a date was set. The rest of
the wedding prep was about to officially begin.
