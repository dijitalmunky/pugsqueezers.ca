We both wanted to get engagement photos done of us to celebrate a big step in
our relationship. We also wanted to incorporate our two fur babies into the
experience since they are now too old to be part of the actual wedding day. We
don't need Pugly peeing on guests and Madi barking at everyone she spots out of
the corner of her eye.

Our style would be slightly urban including a 50s vintage flare. So momma Judy
designed and created a couple of clothing items for Pugly and Madison to wear
that would go with our theme. Right down to a paper boy hat for Pugly and a
poodle skirt for Madi.

Papa Norm had given us red wagon to use to carry the pugs around whenever we
went walking. We wanted to use it in the engagement photos to somewhat contain
the often slow roaming pugs, but to create a few cute photos of the two of us
pulling the wagon. I thought we should have a cute sign on the back of the
wagon. Now I had the task of creating one by myself rather than finding one
online. With some fun fonts, stencil cutting, freehand work, and use of various
pens and pencil crayons... a cute sign had emerged on the back of the wagon
with Chris' help.

Our photographer had also needed to know what we would be wearing for our
photoshoot then she could see the look and the colours. We decided to send her
a couple of photos of us looking goofy. She was very amused but somewhat
disappointed because we hadn't supplied photos of the pugs in their outfits
though. We told her it would just have to be a surprise.

Prepping for the photoshoot was so much fun and the day was even better. The
photos turned out better than we could have hoped for. What a perfect day as a
perfect couple.
