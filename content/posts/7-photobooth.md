Trying to make a photobooth a unique experience is becoming tough now that they
are becoming more popular at weddings. So lets see if this will do the trick.
We are working on our own props that are vintage in nature. So that is a start.
Also, Chris is building it from scratch of his own design!  Another step towards
uniqueness.  Now, we have come up with the idea of creating our own backdrop
using an online image and a printing website.

Trying to pick the correct image is now becoming the tough part. We want it to
be fun, go with our theme and yet something we can create into a piece of
artwork at the end of the wedding. So what do you pick? London, urban, pugs,
outdoors, flowers, vintage, old cars, 1950s... the list goes on.

You will just have to wait and see what we have chosen for your backdrop at
our photobooth in August!
