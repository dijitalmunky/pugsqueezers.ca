I have to start by saying..."Your presence is your present." Please don't feel
that you have to bring us anything. Just having your company at the wedding
will be a wonderful joy for us both. But if you still feel the need to get us
something here is the information.

We are registered at The Hudson Bay - a Canadian company for those overseas.

We are also saving our money for a couple of things.

We will be doing a few home improvements around the house. Updating the
bathrooms and developing the basement are just a few things we can't wait to
tackle.

Also we are planning on purchasing our first trailer, then we can become part
of the Canadian camping tradition. We are totally smitten with the retro 50s
style trailers and think this would be a great asset to our future adventures
as a family. Can you just imagine us in a tear drop trailer with two cute pugs
staring out the window? How adorable!
