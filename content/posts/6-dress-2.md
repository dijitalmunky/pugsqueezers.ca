The wedding dress shopping happened in September, the 10th to be exact. David's
Bridal had informed me the dress wouldn't be ready until sometime in December.
That wasn't a problem. I had made sure we found the dress well in advance of
the wedding day. Then... in October I got a call. A call from David's Bridal
telling me my dress was ready for pickup!

**SAY WHAT!?**

I am not sure what I said on the phone to the sales assistant. I was extremely
excited and I believe the poor lady got the full extent of it.

Good news though, I was meeting my mom in Edmonton that weekend which meant we
were able to pickup the dress and my mom could take it home to Edson away from
any chance of the dress being seen by my sweetheart by accident.

I was still stunned over the beauty of the dress as I opened the bag in our
hotel room to let the dress relax instead of being bunched up. A tear came to
my eye briefly as I imagined how beautiful I had looked in it just weeks
before. Another part of the wedding was falling into place. How exciting!
