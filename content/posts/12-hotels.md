In a previous post, we shared engagement photos we shot on the exterior of one
of Red Deer's hidden gems: **Queen's Diner**.

Well, the outside was just the beginning. To get the full vintage feel, we shot
inside the diner right at closing time as well.  It was so much fun.  Our
photographer, [Jennifer](http://www.donnellyphotography.ca/), also had them make
us up an old fashioned milkshake for some extra fun shots.

Hope you enjoy!
