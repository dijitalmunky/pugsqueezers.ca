Red Deer is such an amazing community.  We have a fairly lively arts community,
downtown is full of awesome little small businesses, there are great startups that
call Red Deer home.  The list goes on.  Even after having lived here off and on
for the better part of 20 years, I am still finding "hidden gems".  One of those
was uncovered when we did our engagement photos.

For our engagement photoshoot, our photographer, the amazing [Jennifer
Donnelly](http://www.donnellyphotography.ca/), suggested that we head to the
[_Queens Diner_](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Queen's+Diner/@52.2982425,-113.8742298,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x537454888498d079:0x8fecf84d02c27291!8m2!3d52.2982425!4d-113.8720411)
(in the Queens Industrial Park) to get some of that vintage feel that we are
both so fond of.  Boy, she did not disappoint...  Queens Diner has it's own
vintage gas station!

Anyways, we kicked off our fun filled day of photos posing on old cars and
around the service station.  The results were nothing short of amazing.  We
hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
