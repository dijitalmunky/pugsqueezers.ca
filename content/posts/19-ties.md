Wow, what a month!  April just flew by! Finally, though, we have a new update!

I have said "yes" to the suit.  All that I shall reveal is exactly what I told
Emma:  I am going to be sporting a red smoking jacket with black lapels. That is
only because I thought the leopard skin one was a little too much.

In addition, the bow ties for the guys arrived today. I ordered them from
[The Tie Bar](http://www.thetiebar.com). I have used these guys many times and
they are simply amazing.  See the pictures below for a little unwrapping tour.

But guess what?  It might stop a little short...I guess you'll just need to
wait for the big day! (Actually, I want to surprise my groomsmen with theirs,
so I didn't want to spoil what theirs look like on the blog, hehe).

Finally, Emma and I have also picked out and ordered our wedding rings.  All of
a sudden things got a lot more real (in the best way possible)! We are both so
excited!
