We have been on the hunt since the engagement in March for a few vintage items
for the wedding. Such as a vanity case for the cards, a Brownie camera and hat
for props at our photo booth. We want this to be a unique experience and one
that totally reflects us as a couple. So you will see a whole bunch of items
from the 1950s. Anything from old candy dishes to handkerchiefs to wipe your
tears of joy.

Some of the items we have been hunting for, well, my mom mostly, are props. Can
you just imagine a photo booth with vintage gloves, 1950s cat-eye glasses and an
old paper boy cap?... well we can and we can't wait to see what the photos will
be like from such a booth. We will have a wedding Instagram set up to share
the hilarious photos.
