Chris and I have been working on gathering all the necessary items to create a
whole lot of wedding favours. The jars were a challenge at the beginning after
we realized how many we would need. I cleaned out the shelves of several stores.
Now we are in the search for ribbon after several spools didn't go nearly as far
as we thought they would. Also while my mom was in Red Deer I had her working
on cutting out over a 130 squares with pinking shears. And Chris has been given
the task to get all the goodies that will go inside them once they are ready to
put together.

I didn't realize all the details that would be involved in a wedding and it
just shows how even doing wedding favours, which in the grand scheme of things
is a very small part, takes up so much time and effort. And yet it is all still 
so fun envisioning these details and seeing them come to life. Now I just can't
wait until we can start creating the completed wedding favours!
