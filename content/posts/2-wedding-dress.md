September 10, 2016 started off very early as Julie, my future mother-in-law,
arrived at the house. She greeted me and the pugs. No, wait...she greeted the
pugs for a while and then realized she hadn't hugged me or said "hi" to me yet.
Then we waited a few moments until Candace, my maid-of-honour, arrived from
Calgary. The wedding dress search road trip was about to begin.

We were heading to Edmonton to three wedding dress stores. The day had finally
arrived where I would feel like a princess while modelling flowing, elaborate
white dresses. After a bunch of research and a goof up booking a dress shop in
Vancouver, I had found three stores to begin the search for the perfect dress.

Even though we were all a little sleepy and while sipping on a Tim Horton's
coffee Candace and I had a good chat. We hadn't seen each other since the
summer. We discussed a few of the decisions Chris and I had made about the
wedding. Plus generally played catch up on our lives.

We arrived! We met my mom and sister at the hotel. Julie opened the back of her
vehicle to hand us all bags of unexpected goodies. Water cups, funny tissues
and candies. The trip was already becoming so much fun. We all climbed into
Helen's SUV and I drove us all to the first destination in Sherwood Park. We
were all laughing and chatting like a bunch of teenage girls. It wasn't even
10 am yet!

We all blew into the dress shop with so much excitement as I explained I had
an appointment. I was given 5 clips to place on 5 dresses I wanted to try on.
I was already overwhelmed. I had decided to go into this experience with no
real idea of what dress I wanted. I had only had a few clippings from a couple
of magazines with me. Who knew it would be so hard to get into a wedding dress?
By the time I had tried on my fifth dress, I had figured out the best approach
to actually getting into these elaborate dresses. I began going in from the
bottom and tunnelling through to the light. I felt like I was being given birth
to. What a crazy experience!

We were goofy and laughed a whole bunch but, we did also discovered what kind of
fabrics, amounts of lace and bling suited me. At the first store "we found
the dress". But we continued onto the next appointment, just in case.

At the second store we had the same kind of clip system. This time all the
dresses I picked were plus sized. It was a wonderful feeling to actually have a
dress fit much better and they gave a much more accurate picture. I allowed the
group to have a "veto" dress. I didn't really like it. Then I tried it on and
it became **"THE DRESS"**. But we decided to continue on to our last store.

After lunch we headed to the south end of Edmonton to *David's Bridal*. Things
were a little different at this store. The sales assistant talked to me about
what style of dress I was looking for. We discussed what dresses I had already
tried on and what seemed to work best. After 10 minutes the assistant came back
with a handful of dresses in my size. Each of them I didn't really like, but
she asked me to tell her why I didn't like them. We were all getting frustrated
by this process because it seemed like we weren't finding any dresses. Then
things began to improve drastically as we discovered what did or didn't look
good on me. It was now getting hard to decide. ***THEN***...I came out of the
room with a huge smile on my face. I thought I had found **THE DRESS** for sure
this time. Then I saw the faces of my two moms, my best friend and my sister.
It was confirmed. **IT WAS THE DRESS!**

The sales assistant asked if I was saying "Yes to the dress". I said **YES!**
She came back with a bell for me to ring. She explained the store had had a
long tradition that when a bride said "Yes to the Dress" she would ring the
bell and make a wish. So I rang the bell, closed my eyes and made a wonderful
wish for the future.

What a day! After just three stores and a countless number of dresses, the
**one** had been found and we were all exhausted. After supper we retired to
our rooms.

Helen had her own while the rest of us were in a suite. We had planned on a
wild night. Instead we were in bed by 10 and all sleeping and snoring.

In the morning, we had breakfast together and then parted our ways again. What
a wonderful time we all had. I was so happy to have had these wonderful ladies
at my side to be goofy, supportive, stubborn, and a whole lot of awesome.
