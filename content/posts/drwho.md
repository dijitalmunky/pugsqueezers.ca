You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine
with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. I'm Dr.
James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. What? What?! WHAT?! You need to
get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find
a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. Aw,
I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of
good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am
now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.
Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I
can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the
curse of the Time Lords. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any
butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? I'm the Doctor, I can save
the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! I'm
Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory.

There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race
called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost.
Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.
Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I
travelled through time and space with her mother! River, you know my name. You
whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my
name. There's only one time I could...
