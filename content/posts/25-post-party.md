Wow! We're married! What an amazing day! What beautiful people! Our thoughts are
all jumbled.  Breathe, Chris, breathe...

Emma and I would sincerely love to thank each and every one of you.  You guys all made
our day so very special.  It was awesome to see so many people dress in theme.
That was the icing on the cake for us! We also found out that many of you discovered
two of our favourite shopping spots:  [Blame Betty](https://blamebetty.com/) in
Calgary, and [Bella Lu's](https://bellalusinc.com/) here in Red Deer.

We couldn't have asked for better weather (thanks for bearing with the mini heat
wave inside the Shed ;) ).  It was awesome to see so many people take advantage
of the games, both inside and out.

We have also flipped through the photo-booth pictures and will be colour-correcting
and posting them shortly, so stay tuned.  Let's just say they look awesome!

All-in-all, Emma and I had the wedding we dreamed of and a huge part was because
of you!  So thank you from the bottom of our hearts for attending and
showing your support!

We'd also like to give a huge shout out to the following people:
-   **Our parents**, Judy and Graham Wilcox and Norm and Julie Roe.  Without them,
    this day would not have come together.  You guys continue to show us nothing
    but love and support, and for that we are truly grateful.
-   **Our wedding party**, Candace, Helen, Addi, Jeff, Bruce and Merric.  You all
    are the best damn wedding party ever. You all just jumped to whatever needed
    to be done, mostly without even being asked!  We are blessed to have
    friends and family like you!
-   **Our ushers**, Michelle, Amanda and Lisa.  You ladies did such an amazing job of
    ensuring that the ceremony and reception went off without a hitch!  Again, we
    are truly blessed to have framily such as you!
