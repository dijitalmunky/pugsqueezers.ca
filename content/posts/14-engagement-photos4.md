As many of you know, Emma came with two cute extras: Pugly and Madison, her
pugs. They have since become "our" pugs, and I couldn't be more thrilled.
They add so much humour and extra love to our lives, it's unbelievable. I
never thought I'd be that guy that referred to his pets as "kids", but
these two have stolen my heart, and made me that guy!

Pugly has always been "Mommy's Boy", and Madi has become "Daddy's Girl".

Even though they are getting a little older (Pugly is 12 and we suspect Madi is
around the same age), they are doing very well.  However, because of their age,
we've made the decision that they won't be in the wedding directly, as much as
we'd love that to be the case.  Instead they get a spa weekend at
[Ruff 'N' Tumble](http://www.ruffntumble.ca/).  These guys are so good to our
four legged friends, that the kids come home exhausted and super happy.

Even though they can't be in the wedding itself, they are still part of our
wedding party.  Pugly is going to be my "Best Pug".  Madison has the
distinguished honour of being Emma's "Maid of cuteness" (sorry Candace, Helen
and Addi!).

Because of our bond with these little goofballs, they __*had*__ to be a part of
our engagement photos.  Thanks to Judy, Emma's Mom, these two looked extra
adorable that day.  Thank you so much Judy!

We took these photos in the beautiful parkland that you can find all around
Red Deer.  These ones were taken on the trails on the south side of the old
train bridge that crosses the river.

For your enjoyment, and likely an overload of cuteness, we now present
"The Kids"!
