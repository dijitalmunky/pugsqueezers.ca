June 3rd was a slightly busy day. Firstly my mom and I drove to Edmonton for my
first dress fitting. It went amazingly well and I was extremely excited to see
my dress on myself again. I felt that magical sparkle.

Then mom and I headed back to Red Deer ready for my Bridal Shower. I was a quite
excited but yet a little nervous too. I am not one to be the centre of attention
usually. But since this is the lead up to the big day I knew this was just the
beginning. In the end though once I got to the party and began mingling with
family and friends the nerves were gone.

Candace, my maid of honour, knows me so well and worked with Maureen and I
assuming a few others, to get this event put together. It was Alice in
Wonderland themed. Many of you may or may not know... it is one of my favourite
Disney movies and I loved the strange book too. I have several tattoos showing
my love for this tale. PLUS... it is how Chris proposed to me via a Alice
scavenger hunt, super romantic. Anyways... the party was amazing, delightful,
fun, and I was truly treated like a queen and spoiled beyond my wildest dreams.
The decorations, the punch that either made you smaller or taller, the games,
the key themed board of suggestions "Keys to a successful marriage", the tea
with teacups, and the incredibly delightfully creative Alice cake. Apart from it
looked beautiful, it was scrumptious!

This day I bubbled over with such emotion. I may not have shown it but I know I
had a grin from ear to ear. I love you all so much for thinking of me, even if
you attended or couldn't make it, you all made me feel so special.
