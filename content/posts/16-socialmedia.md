Guess what, we have an Instagram account setup for the both of us and it
should be used for our wedding. Check out:

You are already following us via our blog, so why not follow us on Instagram
too? We haven't posted too much on there yet, but we thought it would be a
great way to document the photos at the wedding and the photo booth images too.
Instagram will be a great way for everyone to relive the day again and again
through the photos of the event. Anyone can post their pictures and all you
need to do is hashtag the pictures like so:

[#pugsqueezers](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pugsqueezers/)

that way everyone can see the photos on one account.

I can't wait to see all the beautiful, fun, goofy, and breath taking photos
everyone will take. Hope to see our follower numbers begin to grow on our
account. Any questions about Instagram just ask someone under the age of 12
and they can explain everything about this other form of social media. HA!
