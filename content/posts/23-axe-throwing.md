June 17th started off to be a most excellent day.  The future in-laws were in
town.  Emma and her Mom were off to Edmonton do some girlie wedding stuff.  
Emma's dad and I decided that we should go for breakfast at the local Ricky's.

After breakfast, we had a minor task to fix the trunk release on Emma's car
(affectionately called the "trunk monkey").  We
had been trying to figure out what the problem was over text messages for the past week,
to no avail.  However, Graham showed me how to troubleshoot it and trace the
wiring to the various sources.  He also gave me a crash course in relays and how
the dash comes apart.  After about an hour or so, we had the dash to pieces and
back together, and the trunk monkey was finally working again.

Shortly after that, the call from my brother came.  He was on his way to pick his father in law, my
dad, Graham (my father in law) and I up to take us to my bachelor party.  We were going to Sylvan
Lake to pretend we were lumberjacks and throw axes at targets!  If you have
never done this before, it is easier than it looks, and a tonne of fun to boot!  
I highly recommend you try it.  

When we got to the [Wood Shed](http://woodshedaxe.ca/), I was greeted by about 8
other of my friends.  It was going to be a great time.  Some of these guys I
hadn't seen in a while, due to all of our lives being crazy and not lining up.
Over the next two hours, we learned to throw axes and even had a little tournament!
We also got to try our hand at the old school two-person saw that you see in
lumberjack competitions.  Let me tell you, that is a lot of work and a lot harder
that it looks!

After that, we went back to my brother's for a BBQ and more shenanigans.  However,
according to the Bro Code, I am not allowed to share any of the details...hehe.
Suffice it to say, I survived, intact and able to get up and take Emma's dad and my dad
out for breakfast for Father's Day the next day.

Anyways, my co-best man, Bruce, provided some excellent photos of us enjoying the
axe throwing part of the day.  Please enjoy them below!  Also, I'd like to thank
all the guys for coming and for giving me a great and memorable send off from
single life (and also for going very easy on me!).
