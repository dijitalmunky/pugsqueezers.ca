It will be summer when we are having our wedding and we know that camping season
is in full swing for most Canadians. So, why not think about bringing your
trailer to Red Deer?... Here are a few places to check into to help you figure
out what would work best for you. You can also see the "Camping" menu in the
top right corner of this site for links.

Feel free to bring your 'home away from home' along for the ride out to Red Deer
and the Roe - Wilcox wedding in August!
