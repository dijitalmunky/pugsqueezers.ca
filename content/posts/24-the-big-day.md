Well, there are 3 days left until Emma and I tie the knot!!!  OMG, OMG, OMG!!
Thanks to Emma's fantastic organizing abilities and lots of help from family,
we are having a relatively stress free few days before the wedding (we are
sitting in a coffee shop waiting to go to massages as I write this).

Anyways, we thought it would be prudent to do a quick blog post with a reminder
of a few details of the big day.  The itinerary for the day is:
-   **3:00pm**
    -   Guests start arriving.  There is parking on site, you will turn left just
    as you enter the yard ("P" on the map above, plus there are lots of signs).
-   **4:00pm**
    -   The "unification" ceremony starts. The ceremony ("C" on the map above) will
    be off the veranda at the back of the house.  Near the end of the ceremony
    we will have everyone turn and look to top balcony so the photographer can get
    a shot of everyone.  
-   **4:30pm**
    -   Social time begins.  Please make your way to "The Shed" (with the chair
    from your ceremony, if you are able), where you can hang out and catch up
    with people, find your dinner seats, take part in one of the many games
    (Giant Jenga, Yardzee, Croquet, Shut the box, etc.), or get dressed up and
    get funny pictures taken at the photo booth!  The Shed is marked as "R"
    on the map.
    -   The wedding party departs to have their souls stolen by the camera.
-   **5pm**
    -   Bar service starts.  We are having a toonie bar, so will be selling
    tickets.  Please bring a small bit of cash for this.
-   **6pm**
    -   Wedding Party arrives, and dinner begins. Speeches to follow dinner.
-   **8ish**
    -   Boogie time. Get your dancing shoes on and prepare to cut some rug. Or
    kick off your shoes and have a sock hop!
-   **10pm**
    -   Shuttle arrives. Transportation back to Red Deer, Blackfalds and Lacombe
    is provided for those who need/want it.  Bus will be outside the front of
    "The Shed".
-   **12am**
    -   Last call.
-   **1am**  
    -   Shuttle service ends.

We are super excited to see all of you! As we are not having a receiving line, we
will be around to each table during the dance to see everyone.  We hope you have
a blast!
