After many months (okay, maybe a year...) of hard work, the photo booth is
almost ready!

Being one that loves to learn, I took this opportunity to play with and use
some technology I had been dying to learn and another that I felt I really
needed some practice with.  Unfortunately, that meant that the project took
much longer than I had anticipated and longer than I could've done it in if I'd
stuck to what I knew.  But where is the fun in that?

Fortunately, I am marrying one of the most understanding people I have ever
known, so she gave me the space and support to take on such a project.  Emma,
you are the best!

Anyways, near the beginning of this month, it was time to move onto phase 2
of the project -- designing and building the housing for the electronics. Being
people of creative, artsy and sometimes whimsical influences, Emma and I
decided to fashion the housing after one of the props we picked up for pictures:
A vintage 50s Kodak Brownie Camera.

Time to put my design skills to work, and bring my woodworking skills out of
winter dormancy!  Originally, I wanted to try to make a one-to-one copy of the
Brownie camera, however, after some sketching, it turned out that wasn't quite
feasible because of the screen needed for people to interact with.

Some quick brainstorming and consultation with the Mrs.-to-be and we settled on
a Brownie inspired version instead.  We are incredibly happy with the result and
hope you all have as much fun using it as I did making it!
