Time for another set of awesome engagement photos!

Ever since Emma and I have known each other we have always brought out the fun
side in each other.  I think it just proves how comfortable we are with each
other, as well as how much we both are kids at heart (not to mention being
made for each other ;) ).

Anyways, our awesome photographer, [Jennifer Donnelly](http://donnellyphotography.ca/),
was amazing at capturing our goofy and fun sides.  In fact, we gave her many
giggles and laughs as we did our shoot.

Enjoy these selections of goofy and silly photos of us!  We can't wait to show
you a bit of our goofy sides in August!
