Judy, Julie, Chris and I have been working on the handkerchief box full of
vintage handkerchiefs. Chris and I have been adding bows to each one with a
piece of blue ribbon. It is turning out to be a cute vintage idea for the
wedding ceremony.

I have also been working on various wood signs... from some that are small table
numbers to one that is quite a bit larger that will be setup at the ceremony.
They just need a few more finishing touches. Plus a little bit of attention
from Chris and they will be ready for the wedding day.
